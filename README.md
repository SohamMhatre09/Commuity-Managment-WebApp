Create an easy-to-use platform that helps communities plan and track local clean-up events, allowing volunteers to sign up, log collected waste, and visualize the impact, fostering a cleaner environment.

Communities worldwide are increasingly recognizing the importance of environmental supervision, and organizing local clean-up events plays a crucial role in fostering a cleaner and healthier environment. However, there is a need for a user-friendly platform that streamlines the process of planning and tracking these events while engaging volunteers effectively. The solution should include an intuitive and easy-to-use platform dedicated to community clean-up initiatives. This platform aims to empower communities to seamlessly plan and coordinate local clean-up events, simplifying the organization process for both event organizers and volunteers.
